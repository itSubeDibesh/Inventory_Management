## Database Selection
There are multiple databases around the market but every solution has its own caveat. Amoung all database I prefer MySQL a better solution for my project. Major problem with my project is to maintain relation between different modules which is only possible via sql database solution. MySQL is open source database solution and is flexible with [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) and [MySqlWorkbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) as well. If you are wondering differences between __phpMyAdmin__ and __MySqlWorkbench__ feel free to visit [mysql-workbench-vs-phpmyadmin](https://stackshare.io/stackups/mysql-workbench-vs-phpmyadmin).

I will be using __MySqlWorkbench__ as my prior tool but configuring it to __phpMyAdmin__ is a piece of cake.  
## Features of Database
Some of the major features of MySQL are as follows:

- High Performance – Provides fast load utilities with distinct memory caches and table index partitioning.
- Low Total Cost Of Ownership – This reduces licensing costs and hardware expenditures.
